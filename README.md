### Installation

On Ubuntu, pyvrui can be installed from the [KeckCAVES PPA][keckcaves-ppa].

   ```sh
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:keckcaves/ppa
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python-pyvrui
   ```

To manually build and install pyvrui you will need to install [SWIG][swig]
along with some other dependencies. On Ubuntu, you can run the following
command.

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install build-essential swig2.0
   ```

**NOTE:** You must install the 2.0 version of SWIG (`swig2.0`). The earlier
release (`swig`) will not work.

You will also need to have the VRUI development library installed. This is also
available in [KeckCAVES PPA][keckcaves-ppa].

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libvrui3.1-dev
   ```

To build and install the python module, simply run the following commands
in the project's root directory.

   ```sh
   python ./setup.py build
   sudo python ./setup.py install
   ```
